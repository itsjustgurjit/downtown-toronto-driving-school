Adapting your vehicle can be a great way to express your personality - whether connected to the tinted window, upgrading the exhaust system or installing customized lighting. In Canada, however, the law on the vehicle's modification is strict. Violations of them can be removed from the road by ticket, unsuccessful inspection or even your vehicle.

What should you know here before switching cars.

1. Window tin rules
Tinted Windows can improve privacy and reduce dazzling, but the provinces determine specific restrictions on how dark thawing can occur and where it is allowed.

Windshield: Most provinces prohibit any tint on the windshield, except for a narrow strip at the top.

The front window: Prohibition of provinces such as Ontario and British Columbia, which blocks more than a certain percentage of light, often measured as visible light transfer (VLT).

Back and back windows: Rules are usually more flexible, and dark color tones are often allowed.

If the color is very dark, the police can get a fine or you have to remove it before driving the vehicle again.

2. High exit and noise limit
A modified exit can give your vehicle a sportier sound, but excessive noise is regulated.

Provinces set maximum decibel restrictions for exit noise, especially in urban areas.

It is generally prohibited to remove the factory -installed muffler or install a straight pipe system.

In British Columbia, police may use sound meters to measure noise, while other provinces rely on officer discretion.

3. Light changes
Custom lighting can increase the appearance of the car, but some types are prohibited:

Red or blue lights in front are reserved for emergency vehicles.

Flashing or strobe lights are prohibited for non-emergency use.

Sub -glow lighting can be legal in some provinces, but often the rules of color and shiny patterns should be followed.

4. Suspension and lifting sets
Adjusting the height of the vehicle for style or terrain performance is allowed within the area.

Province of Cap can earn how much you can pick up or reduce the vehicle from the height of the factory.

Safety inspections can prevent vehicles with converted suspension geometry or withdrawal problems.

5. Motor and performance change
Upgrading that affects the vehicle's power, fuel system or emission output should follow provincial and federal standards.

Removal of catalyst converters or change of emission control is illegal nationwide.

Some changes require certification to prove that the vehicle remains safe and on the road.
