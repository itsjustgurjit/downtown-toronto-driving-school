Whether it's a weekend trip with your dog or a quick veterinarian for your cat, it's a common part of life for many Canadians. But when we love our beloved (and sometimes winged) peers, inappropriate transport can lead to the risk of both animals and drivers. In Canada, there are important security guidelines - and in some provinces, legal requirements - you should know before you kill your pets.

Canadian Laws on Driving with Pets
Canada doesnâ€™t have a single national pet travel law, but provinces and territories enforce regulations under animal welfare, distracted driving, and transportation safety rules:

Animal Welfare Acts

Provinces like Ontario, BC, and Alberta have laws against transporting animals in a way that may cause injury or distress. This includes riding loose in a truck bed without proper restraint.

Stop suddenly or throw around the vehicle in a collision.

Avoid when doors or windows open unexpectedly.

Press the heat in a hot vehicle if left.

Not only is your pet important for your safety - it is also necessary for you and other road users.
