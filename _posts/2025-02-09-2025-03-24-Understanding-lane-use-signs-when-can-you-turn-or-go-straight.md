In Canadian cities and highways, the use of Lane is one of the most important traffic control units. They tell the drivers what movements are allowed from each path - whether you can go straight, swing or both. They may be misunderstood that fines, dangerous changes in the last seconds and conflict.

When you know how to explain these signs, you are in the right place at the right time and help stream the traffic flow smoothly.

What are indications for using lanes?
Signs of indications for using lane show which guidelines are allowed from a given orbit. They can be:

Suspended overhead signal over each orbit

Roadside sign before crossing

Sidewalks with directly painted arrows on the road

Most are black symbols on a white background, which means they are regulatory signs - you should follow them by law.

Regular lane types
Only

A single arrow upwards means that you can only continue directly in the future.

There is no left or right twist from this path.

Just bend

A curved arrow to the left or right means you need to change in that direction from the path.

It is illegal to go straight or try to turn directly with a swing field.

Court

The combination of a straight arrow and a curved arrow lets you either go straight or indicate a turn.

Example: In many right streets you can either turn right or move straight ahead.

Multi -track control

Overhead signals on multi-field roads can show different directions for each path. These are especially common in busy intersections and motorway outputs.

The use of time -based orbit

Some streets only have directional restrictions in a few hours.

Example: "Strait or left turn - from 07:00 to 21.00" means that other movements can be allowed outside these hours.

Interpretation
In most cases, the forefruit matches the indications of the use of the track that has been laid out. However, if they are separate, the indications that are posted legal prioritization can close or vague, but the signals are used.

Special circumstances
Bus/transit track: The use of a track may indicate that only buses can use a certain track or a certain twist.

HOV Lanes: High-occupancy vehicle lanes sometimes have specific permitted movements shown on lane use signs.

Construction area: Use of temporary track signal when overriding general rules.

Penalty for ignoring lane use
Violation of a symbol of lane is considered a traffic offense in each province.

Ontario: About $ 85 Bot plus 2 Demerit points.

British Columbia: $ 121 Bot.

Quebec: $ 100- $ 200 fine.

Alberta: $ 155 bot.

Beyond the fine, the use of inappropriate lane can cause accidents and increase the insurance rate.

Tips to keep you in the right path

The least-to-minus lane can be dangerous.

Follow the time limit for the lane with the posted hours.

Use GPS with track guidance in unknown areas.
