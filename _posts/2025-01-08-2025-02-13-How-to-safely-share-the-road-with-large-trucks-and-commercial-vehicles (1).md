Canadian highways and city roads are divided by a wide mix of vehicles - from small hatchbacks to large transport cars across the country. While large trucks and commercial vehicles are crucial to our economy, they also have unique challenges for other drivers.

Understanding their boundaries and adjusting your driving can then make the roads safe for everyone.

Why large trucks need special attention
Size and weight: A fully loaded tractor trailer can weight up to 63,500 kg in Canada-20 times more of the weight of a passenger car.

Long distance: Trucks require more time and space to break safely.

Limited visibility: Large blind spots mean that truck drivers cannot see small vehicles in the side or behind them.

Wide turn: Trucks often swing wide to swing, especially to the right, which can catch the drivers with the guard.

Understand Truck Blind Spots ("No-Zone")
Trucks have four main blind spots:

Front: About 6 meters in front of the cab.

Back: About 60 meters behind the trailer.

Left: Back to the back of the cab.

Right: Very big from left - to avoid here.

Rule of thumb: If you can't see the truck driver's face in the side mirror, they probably can't see you.

Secure driving tips around trucks
Fit quickly and safely

Always go through the left, where the visibility is better.

Not next to the truck; Maintain a stable speed.

Give them space when they are merged

The truck is never carefully cut in front of the truck - its long distance can collide if you suddenly take a break.

Watch for Wide Turns

If a truck is turning right, don’t squeeze between the truck and the curb—it could lead to a dangerous “right-turn squeeze” crash.

Look for wide twist

If a truck gets right, not squeezing the truck and curb can make a dangerous "right-turn squeez" Stay back to the hills

Large trucks can retreat a bit when they start from stops at a propensity.

Be patient

Trucks accelerate slower, especially when fully loaded. Telgating or aggressive driving expanded them rapidly and increased the risk.

Commercial vehicle in urban areas
In cities, delivery cars, buses and other large commercial vehicles constantly stop:

Try to remove passengers or goods.

Give a quick signal and hold at a safe distance.

Remember that some delivery cars can block a track part - bus under and only pass when safe.

Winter and bad weather views
Trucks kick several sprays and slices, reduce the visibility - put on the wiper and light.

Increase in the following distance on icy roads; The long distance to a truck also applies to you.

In strong headwinds, large trailers can give them extra space.

Valid Reminder
Many provinces impose fines on unprotected passage, especially in building or truck-related areas.

Distracted or aggressive driving around commercial vehicles can also lead to high insurance penalties if you are in an error in an accident.
