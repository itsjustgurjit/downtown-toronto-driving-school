The degradation of a roadside can be stressful, especially if it occurs on a busy highway or in a stiff Canadian season. Knowing what to do - and what you should not do - can protect yourself, protect your passengers and reduce the dangers of other road users.

1. Stay calm and evaluate the situation
The first step is to remain calm and evaluate quickly what is happening. Is this a flat tire, motor problem or overheating problem? Understanding the problem will help you determine your next step and communicate clearly with roadside assistance.

2. Pull safely
If possible, take the vehicle to shoulder, emergency or a safe side road. Avoid stopping in the traffic field. Turn on the danger lighting immediately to consume other drivers.

Tip: On the highways, aims to stay as much as possible, leaving enough space between the car and the traffic flow.

3. Make you visible
Safety is about visibility. In addition to dangerous lights:

If you have used contemplative warning triangle or torches.

If you need to go out, you can use a reflective safety vest.

Keep the parking lights at night or in case of low shift.

4. Stay inside the vehicle (most of the time)
If you are on a busy road or highway, it is usually the safest to stay inside your car with the seat belt unless there is help. If you are in a safe area and away from moving traffic, just finish.

5. Call for help
If you are in danger, you can contact the roadside, a tug or the emergency services. Coverage through many Canadian drivers:

CAA (Canadian Automobile Association)

Manufacturer's assistance at the roadside

The insurance company ad-on

Be sure to give your exact location near the exit, places or GPS coordinates.

6. Know when to try basic repair
If you are in a safe place and are confident in your skills, you can replace a flat tire or fill up coolant. However, avoid repair on the shoulder to a high-speed road-this is not worth the risk.

7. Be ready for Canadian season
Winter distribution requires additional precautions:

Keep blankets, warm clothing, and non-perishable snacks in your emergency kit.

Avoid running the engine continuously - instead, run it at a short interval of fuel conservation while staying warm.

Keep the exhaust pipe clear of snow to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.

8. After the Incident
When you get back on the road:

Follow the vehicle with a mechanic to prevent repeated fracture.

Fill the supply on any emergency kit you used.
