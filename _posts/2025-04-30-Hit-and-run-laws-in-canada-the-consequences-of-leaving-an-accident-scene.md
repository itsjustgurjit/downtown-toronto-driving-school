Apart from an accident site - which is usually known as a hit and run - is one of the most serious crimes that a driver can do in Canada. What causes damage to property, injury or death requires the Canadian law to prevent drivers, exchange information and provide help. Failure to do so can lead to serious legal, financial and personal consequences.

1. What Constitutes a Hit and Run?
A hit and run occurs when a driver is involved in a collision and fails to:

Stop at the scene

Provide their name, address, and driver’s licence number to the other party or police

Offer reasonable assistance to anyone injured

This applies whether the crash involves another vehicle, a cyclist, a pedestrian, or even stationary property like a fence or parked car.

2. Your Legal Duty After an Accident
Under Canada's criminal law and provincial traffic actions need all drivers:

Stop immediately in a safe place.

Check for damage if necessary and call emergency services.

Exchange of details with other parties (name, contact information, license plate, insurance).

Report the accident to the police on provincial rules (usually for significant injury, injury or death).

3. Criminal Penalties for Hit and Run
If you leave the scene of an accident:

Only property damage: Penalty, license suspension and possible gel can be time based on severity.

Physical injury: Can be imprisoned up to 10 years.

Dead: Maximum punishment is life imprisonment.

Even if you did not make a mistake for the accident, there may be criminal charges by leaving the scene.

4. Provincial Consequences
In addition to the Criminal Code, the provinces impose their own restrictions, which may include:

Long -term license suspension

Demerit point

Mandatory driver re -education program

Insurance premium increases or cancels coverage

5. Why Some Drivers Flee — and Why It’s Always a Bad Decision
Some drivers are nervous, afraid of legal consequences, or believe that the incident is very modest to report. Others may run without insurance, suspended license or in force.
Whatever the reason, running will almost always make your situation worse. The law leaves the view as a fault, and the punishment may be more stiff than itself for an accident.

6. What to Do If You’re Involved in a Collision
Pull immediately and turn on the danger light.

Check if anyone is damaged and call 911 if necessary.

Exchange of information with all parties involved.

Take pictures of the stage for insurance purposes.

Report the incident to the police if it is legally necessary.
