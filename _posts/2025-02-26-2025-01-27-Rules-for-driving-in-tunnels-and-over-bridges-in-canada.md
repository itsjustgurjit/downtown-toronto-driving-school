Various road networks in Canada include impressive bridges and essential tunnels that combine cities, provinces and remote areas. Although they may feel like another part of the trip, both tunnels and bridges require specific driving behavior to ensure protection and compliance with laws.

Whether you cross the Confederation Bridge in Maritimes, understanding of the rules can make your journey smooth and safe.

General Legal Requirements
Across Canadian provinces, driving laws in tunnels and on bridges fall under provincial highway acts, municipal bylaws, and sometimes federal regulations for major crossings. Common legal requirements include:

Obey posted the speed limits

Speed limits in tunnels and on bridges are often lower than the surrounding roads for safety and stability.

Sudden speed changes can cause overload or accidents.

No restrictions or parking

Living on a bridge or inside a tunnel is prohibited except for an emergency.

If you are going to stop, use Hezard Lights and if available, go to the specified emergency bay.

Follow track check signals

Some tunnels and bridges have light lights or directional arrows - these are legally used.

Keep the distance after safe time

Close quarters mean that less space for error support collisions are particularly dangerous in affiliated or high places.

Most provinces require headlights to turn on tunnels, although it is daytime. Automatic lights may not be active enough - test them manually.

No passing

Passing in most tunnels is prohibited due to narrow streets and limited visibility.

Dangerous material restrictions

Commercial vehicles that carry flammable or explosive loads may be prohibited or may require special permits.

Ventilation and output

If traffic stops, it becomes inactive; Modern tunnels are ventilated, but the air quality may still fall.

Special rules for driving on bridges
Air conscious

The bridges are severely exposed to strong headwinds, especially in coastal or open areas. Reduce the speed and hold a company on the steering wheel.

Weight limit

Heavy vehicles should follow weight restrictions to protect the bridge integrity.

Icy state

Bridges often freeze before the surface of the road under the cold air. Slowly and avoid sudden movements in winter.

Toll collection

Some bridges, such as Confederation Bridge or Port Man Bridge, have toll systems - pay attention to the indications for payment methods or transponder lanes.

Safety Tips for Both Tunnels and Bridges
Stay in Your Lane: Avoid driftingâ€”lanes may be narrower than standard highways.

Keep a Steady Speed: Sudden acceleration or braking can cause chain reactions.

Avoid Distractions: Focus entirely on the road; enclosed and elevated spaces demand quick reaction times.

Prepare Before Entry: Check fuel levels, avoid last-minute lane changes, and secure any loose items in your vehicle.

Penalties for Violations
Breaking tunnel or bridge rules can lead to fines, demerit points, and in some cases, criminal charges (e.g., for dangerous driving in restricted areas).

Ontario: Fines range from $85 to $500 for disobeying posted instructions.

British Columbia: Speeding on bridges or tunnels can result in fines over $200 plus penalty points.

Quebec: Hazardous driving in tunnels can result in fines and licence suspensions.
