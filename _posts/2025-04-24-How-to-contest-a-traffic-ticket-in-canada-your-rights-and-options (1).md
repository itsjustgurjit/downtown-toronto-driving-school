Getting a traffic ticket can be frustrating, especially if you believe it was issued in error. In Canada, you have the right to challenge a ticket, and knowing the process can help you present your case effectively while protecting your driving record.

1. Understanding the Type of Ticket You Received
Before deciding to contest, identify the ticket type:

Parking Ticket – Issued by municipalities; usually does not affect your driving record or insurance.

Provincial Offence / Moving Violation – Includes speeding, running a red light, failing to stop, etc.; may come with demerit points and insurance impacts.

2. Deadlines Matter
Each province and territory has strict timelines for contesting tickets—often between 15 to 30 days from the date of issue. Miss the deadline, and you could lose your right to dispute it. Check your ticket for the exact timeframe.

3. Your Options for Contesting a Ticket
Most provinces give you three main choices:

A. Request a Trial
You can plead not guilty and request a trial. This gives you the chance to:

Hear the evidence against you

Question the officer’s testimony

Present your own evidence or witnesses

B. Early Resolution / Settlement Meeting
Some provinces (e.g., Ontario) offer an early resolution meeting with a prosecutor. You can sometimes negotiate:

A reduced fine

Fewer or no demerit points

A lesser charge

C. Written Submissions
In some cases, you can contest a ticket in writing instead of appearing in person, although this is less common for serious offences.4. Collect
To build your case, consider collecting:

Stage pics or videos

Witness statements

Weather and traffic reports

Any relevant document (eg maintenance register for your vehicle)

5. What you can expect in court
In your hearing:

The officer or issuing authority will present the case.

You will have a chance to cross and present your own evidence.

Justice or judges will determine on the basis of facts.

If you lose, you may still have the right to appeal within a specific time limit.

6. When to Seek Legal Help
For serious charges—like stunt driving, careless driving, or offences carrying heavy fines and long suspensions—consulting a traffic lawyer or paralegal can greatly improve your chances.
