Canada's enormous geography means that Ghats is often more in a beautiful way to travel - they have important relationships between provinces, islands and coastal communities. Whether you cross from Vancouver to Vancouver Island, travel to Newfoundland or search for remote northern routes, understanding the rules to bring your vehicle can make your journey smooth and stress -free.

Where vehicles work in Canada
Large vehicle boat services include:

BC Ferries – Serving Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands, and northern BC routes.

Marine Atlantic - adds to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.

Ontario Ferries – Including routes to Pelee Island and Manitoulin Island.

Eastern Canada Ferries – In Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.

Northern Ferries – Seasonal or specialized services in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.

Rules to bring a vehicle on a boat
While each operator can have its own rules, here are general requirements:

Vehicle reservation - most of the large Ghats are required or ordering the vehicle in advance, especially during the high season.

Restriction of vehicle size - Measure the length, width and height of the vehicle, including roof racks, trailers or load boxes. Extra live or large vehicles can pay more price.

Weight limit - heavy vehicles such as RV or trucks with trailers may require special schemes.

Fuel and Security Requirements -

Turn off the engine while staying on the ship.

The propane tank should be closed and may be subject to inspection.

Hazardous materials can be limited.

Boarding and Disembarking – Follow staff directions closely, as loading is organized by vehicle type and destination.

Booking tips for vehicle trips
Order early - summer weekends, holidays and tourist season quickly. Book a week in advance for popular routes or for months.

Arrive Early – Most ferries require you to check in 30–60 minutes before departure with your vehicle.

Learn your dimensions - accurate vehicle measurements help ensure the correct price and boarding area.

Keep in mind that off-pick Times-Yatra can mean afternoon or mid-week means low price and low overload.

Documents are ready - bring ID, confirm the order and any important travel permit if you cross provincial or international water.

Cost and payment
Differently depending on the rent:

Vehicle type (car, motorcycle, RV, truck with trailer)

Passenger count

Length and season on the route

Some boat services provide continuous discounts for passengers, the elderly or the inhabitants of some communities.

Travel with pets and loads
Pets may need to live in the vehicle or specified pets, depending on boat policy.

Attach all loose items to your car as the ferry movement can transfer cargo.
