The mirrors of your vehicle are more than just practical - they are legally necessary safety facilities. They help you monitor the surrounding traffic, spot danger and reduce blind spots. In Canada, there are specific rules of type, number and location of a mirror of a vehicle. Whether you drive cars, motorcycles or commercial trucks, you may know that these rules can help you stay safe - and avoid tickets.

Why mirror substance
Mirror is your eyes that follow you and next to you. Without them, you drive with dangerous blind spots. Appropriate adjusted mirror:

Allow secure path change and fusion

Help prevent conflict with cyclists and pedestrians

Give awareness of going to emergency vehicles

Improve the visibility during rope or reversal

Legal requirements for vehicle mirrors
While the exact word varies from the province, Canada's laws for motor vehicles generally require:

rear

Each vehicle should have a back mirror that provides a clear view of the road through the rear window.

If your view is blocked through the rear window (eg truck, truck with canopy), there should be two functional side mirrors instead.

page mirror

Most provinces require at least one driver's outer mirror and an outer mirror on the passenger side.

Both must be firmly attached, unbroken and provide an uninterrupted view.

Mirrors for the passenger side are especially important for large vehicles and are compulsory for commercial trucks.

Motorcycles

The motorcycle should have at least one, and two in the provinces, rearview mirrors. They should give views of at least 60 meters behind the rider.

Commercial Vehicles

Trucks and buses must have large, properly positioned mirrors on both sides, plus convex or “spot” mirrors to reduce blind spots.

Blind spots and laws
Even with fully placed mirrors, each vehicle has blind spots - it's that you can't see without bending your head.

Legal expectations: Drivers are responsible for changing the streets, merging or examining blind spots before turning.

Failing in the shoulder control can lead to fees such as "unprotected orbit changes" or "return failure".

Maintenance requirements
This is not exactly enough for mirrors; They should be able to do good work:

Panties

Clean and free of frost, ice or dirt

Adjusted properly before starting your journey

Safely mounted

Running with broken or missing mirrors can lead to a fine between $ 85 and $ 200 depending on the province, and in some cases your vehicle can be considered unsafe.

Tips for better mirror use
Adjust before driving: Set the mirror so you can see as much as possible without transferring your head.

Use the "BGE" method: Side mirror for weak angle outward to reduce the overlap with the mirror of the rearview mirror, reduces blind spots.

Mix mirrors with shoulder control: Never trust the mirror alone.

Install blind spot mirrors: Small convex mirrors can help spot vehicles in difficult to-C areas.
