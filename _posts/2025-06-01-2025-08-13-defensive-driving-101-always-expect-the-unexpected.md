In Canadian roads, conditions can be an instant snowmobile, wildlife crossing, sudden lane or bad decisions from another driver. Defensive driving is the skill that prepares you to handle these wonders safely. In the core it is about being careful, estimating risks and taking active steps to avoid accidents.

What is defensive driving?
Defensive driving is over knowing the rules of the road. This is a mentality that says: I cannot control other drivers or the environment, but I can control how I react.

This means that it is always clear for unexpectedly:

Further car sudden braking.

A cyclist to avoid debris.

Black snow on a bridge in January.

Important principles of defensive driving
Be awake and reduce distractions
Keep your attention on the road, mirror and your surroundings. Phones, food or radio with radio can use you to use precious response time.

Keep a safe distance
"Three-second rule" is a good baseline extension of the bad weather or bad visibility.

An estimate of other driver's fault
It is expected that other people can run red lights, fail to indicate or merge aggressively. The plan for these opportunities helps you avoid them.

Adjust for relationships
Rain, snow, dirt roads or building areas require slow speed and steady control entrance.

There is a migration path
Always know where to get on or use brakes if the front street is suddenly blocked.
Why protective driving saves life
Conflict often occurs when drivers are caught by guards. Defense leaders are rarely surprised because they already consider many "if" landscape. This preparation can mean a close conversation and difference between an accident.
