When you are behind the steering wheel, your primary job is simple, but important: Run safely. Still, in today's connected world, distractions are everywhere to have lunch from phone and chat travelers. In Canada, the distracted driving has become one of the main causes of conflict, which is impaired and aggressive driving.

It's not just a matter of bad habits - it's a matter of life and death.

What does it mean as a drifting distraction?
A distraction is all that takes the eyes away from the street, the mind from the steering wheel or driving away from driving. They come in three main types:

Visual distracted - disregard the road (eg check the phone, adjustment of GPS, reads Billboard).

Manual distraction - move your hands away from the wheel (eg, comes for food, care).

Cognitive distracted - focuses mentally (eg daylight, intensive interaction, stress).

Often, distracted overlap. For example, SMS when driving, all three connect.

Canadian law of distracted driving
In the provinces, distracted roads are strict and punishment are severe:

Ontario: A license suspension for a minimum of $ 615 bot, 3 Demerit points and repeated offenses.

British Columbia: $ 368 bot and 4 penalties (add important insurance costs).

Quebec: Fines between $ 300- $ 600 and 5 Demerit points.

Alberta: $ 300 fine, although other fees (such as careless driving) can apply for serious cases.

It is important that these laws cover the use of a hand -caught electronic unit while driving even in red lights.

Concealed cost
According to Transport Canada, drivers double out of the way for just 2 seconds, the risk of accidents. At 100 km/h even a 2-second appearance means that you travel more than 55 meters without looking to remember a threat.

Practical strategies to eliminate distractions
1. Set before you start
Adjust mirrors, seats, climate control and GPs before continuing.

Do your playlist or podcast in advance.

2. Get free from hand
Use Bluetooth or Voice Command for conversation.

If you need navigation (never hold), you must safely mount the phone.

3. Don't Multitask
Eat before or after the trip.

Avoid nurturing, reading or dealing with loose items while driving.

4. Managing passenger districts
Moisture is asked to keep the noise level appropriate.

Name a "co-pilot" to handle GPS or telephone assignments.

5. Stay mentally
Avoid driving when you are extremely tired, stressed or emotionally upset.

Use scan techniques: Check the mirror, see the traffic flow and guess the dangers.

Special Note for new and commercial drivers
The beginner driver (G1, G2 or equivalent) often meets zero option rules for using the phone even free from hands.

Professional drivers can meet high fines and career effects if distracted, as professional driving standards are strict.

If you are going to use your phone
Pull into a safe, legal place (not just in case of emergency to the edge of a highway). Remember: Even to stop in traffic, using your phone is illegal in most provinces until it is free of hands.

The Payoff of Staying Focused
Driving distraction-free doesn’t just keep you legal—it keeps you alive. Staying focused means you can:

Spot hazards earlier

React faster to sudden changes

Protect yourself, passengers, and other road users

When you focus fully on the drive, you make every journey safer—not just for yourself, but for everyone sharing the road.
