When a manufacturer or transport Canada detects security errors in a vehicle, a memory is issued to inform the owners and arrange free repair. Hearing that your car is "missing" can seem worrying, understanding the process can help you function quickly and avoid unnecessary risks.

What do you remember the vehicle?
A revocation of vehicles is an official request from a manufacturer - sometimes instructed by Transport Canada - to repair, change or replace a vehicle that causes security risk or does not meet regulatory standards.

General recall problems are included:

Incorrect collision pad

Brake system failure

Management problems

Fuel system leakage

Electrical defects that can cause fire

Who remembers in Canada?
In Canada, Transport Canadaâ€™s Motor Vehicle Safety Directorate monitors and enforces vehicle safety regulations. Manufacturers must notify both Transport Canada and affected vehicle owners when a defect is found.

How will you be informed
If your vehicle is called back, you should receive a recall alert via e -post from the manufacturer. This announcement will usually include:

Details about errors

Potential security risk

Instructions on how to repair

Contact information for questions

You can also look for recall too:

Use your vehicle's identity number (wine) on the manufacturer's site

Do you have to pay to remember repair?
No, according to the law, regarding the age of the vehicle, the warranty or the mileage, the reverse repairs are independent of safety errors. The manufacturer covers all costs, including parts and labor.
What to do if your vehicle is called back
Read the recall forecast carefully - understand the level of risk and repair instructions.

Contact a dealer - Enter repair time as soon as possible.

Stop driving (if necessary) - if recall involves a severe protective threat, such as the risk of fire or brake failure, consider parking the vehicle for repair.

Store the goods - all communication and repair receipts for future contexts of documents.

What happens if you ignore a memory?
One can miss:

Keep yourself and others at risk of injury or death.

Impress the resale value of your vehicle.

Potential impact insurance requirements if no accident is associated with errors.

Miss and used cars
If you buy a used car, the recall liability will be transferred to you. Always see excellent memories before buying. A sharp alcohol discovery can show that the repair is in anticipation.
