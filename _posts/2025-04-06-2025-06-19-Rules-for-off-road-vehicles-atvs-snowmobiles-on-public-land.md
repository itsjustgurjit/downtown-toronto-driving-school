The huge forests, trails and frozen lakes in Canada make it a paradise for terrain enthusiasts. Whether you cycle on ATV in the summer or a snow root in winter, there are specific laws that govern, where, where and how these vehicles can be used in public countries. Knowing these rules gives you safe, legal and respect for the environment.

What does it mean as a public country?
Public countries consist of ownership and managed areas of federal, provincial or municipal authorities, for example:

Crown land

Provincial and national park

Municipality Green Place

Designated multi -use paths

Not all public countries are open to off -road vehicles and even specific places that the damage rules are different.

License and registration
Most provinces require:

Vehicle Registration - ATV or Snomobile should be registered with the province's authority.

Number plate or delicate - a visual identification plate or sticker is mandatory.

License to a valid driver - is often required to work with public roads or trail transitions.

For example:

In Ontario, all terrain vehicles on public countries must be registered and insured, and snowmobile riders shall have a legitimate driver's license or motorized snow truck motorized operator license (MSVOL).

In British Columbia, ATVs and snowmobiles must be registered through ICBC and display an Off-Road Vehicle plate.

Insurance Requirements
If you cycle on public land, public roads or designated trails, liability insurance is required. The proof of insurance should be done with you at all times.
Where you can cycle
Nominated trails - many provinces have mapped the trail system with clear rules for motorized vehicles.

Frozen waterways - are often allowed for snow judges, but snow checks safety and local rules.

Road transition - is only allowed on specified points and with correct safety relationship rules.

Some areas—such as hiking-only trails, wildlife sanctuaries, and certain protected lands—prohibit motorized vehicles entirely.

Security
In Canada, the following is generally required:

Hjelm-Dot-anonymous, carried by all riders and passengers.

Lights and reflexes - required for night driving or low term.

Proper clothing diarrhea, shoes and weather covered equipment.

Environmental and label rules
Stay on marked trails - prevent residence damage and erosion.

Avoid noise disorders - respect society and wildlife nearby.

Wrap your trash - leave a mark behind.

Criminal penalty for fracture rules
The fine for riding without registration, insurance or permission can account for more than $ 1000. Vehicles can also be planted for serious violations.
