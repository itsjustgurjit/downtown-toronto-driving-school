If you've ever crossed the roadside, can you think: Should I stop and help? In Canada, the law of "good Sami" provides considerable legal protection for those who choose to help in an emergency. Understanding how it works can give you the confidence to work without fear of legal consequences - while still keeping yourself and others safe.

What Is the Good Samaritan Law?
The Good Samaritan law exists to protect individuals who voluntarily help others in emergency situations from being sued if something goes wrong. In the context of roadside accidents, it encourages drivers and bystanders to assist injured people without hesitation.

Important principles include:

Wisdom impact - you can't be forced to help, but if you do, the law protects you.

There is no hope of payment - your work should be of goodwill, not for financial benefits.

Occurs in good faith - you should actually try to help, not the cause of loss.

Provincial variations
Canada does not have a single nationwide good equilibrium law - each province and region has its own version. However, they share general subjects:

Ontario – The Good Samaritan Act, 2001 protects those who provide emergency medical assistance at the scene of an accident.

British Columbia – The Good Samaritan Act offers similar protections for anyone giving aid in an emergency.

Quebec – Under the Civil Code, citizens actually have a legal duty to help if it’s safe to do so.

Other Provinces/Territories – Most have laws shielding helpers from liability as long as their actions are reasonable and not grossly negligent.

Other provinces/regions - most have laws to preserve laws unless their functions are appropriate and it is gross negligence.
What can you do safe in accident at the roadside
First make sure your safety

Park to a safe place, turn on dangerous lights and stay at a safe distance from traffic.

Call 911 immediately

Even if you help, professional emergency services should be notified.

Provide basic first aid

If you are trained, you can CPR, check bleeding or help someone go in protection if they are in immediate danger.

Avoid dangerous tasks

Do not move the injured persons until it is absolutely necessary - it can destroy injuries.

Limits of the Law
The Good Samaritan law doesn’t protect against:

Gross negligence or reckless actions

Offering assistance while under the influence

Demanding payment for help

Acting beyond your knowledge or skill in ways that cause harm

Work beyond your knowledge or skill causing harm

Why does the law mean something
Without this security, people can hesitate to help in fear of matters. The law promotes compassion and culture of rapid action, which can be a difference between life and death on the roadside.
