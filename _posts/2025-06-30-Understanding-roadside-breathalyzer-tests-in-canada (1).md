Roadside breathalyzer tests are one of the most common tools police use to detect impaired driving in Canada. These tests measure a driverâ€™s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and help ensure that those behind the wheel are sober and safe. Understanding how they work, when they can be used, and your rights during the process is essential for every driver.

1. What is a breathing test on the roadside?
A breeder at the roadside, also known as an approved screening device (ASD), is a small -tired handheld machine used by police officers to test for the presence of alcohol during the driver's breath. This provides a quick reading to determine if further tests are required at a police station.

2. When can the police demand testing?
According to the reduced driving laws in Canada, the police may require a breath test on the roadside if:

They have appropriate doubt that you have consumed alcohol.

You are stopped at a sobriety checkpoint or RIDE program.

You have made a traffic violation, and the officer observes signs of loss.

Since December 2018, the Canadian law also allows the police to request a breath test without the need for suspicion, until the driver is legally stopped.

3. Legal liquor cleaning in Canada
For the most fully licensed drivers:

The criminal BAC area is 0.08% (80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood).

For youth, beginners and commercial drivers in many provinces:

The limit is zero tolerance - there is no detectable alcohol in your system.
4. What happens during testing
Officials will explain that you must provide a respiratory test.

Until you ask to stop, you will continuously blow in the mouthpiece.

The device will either show:

Passport (no important alcohol address)

WARNING (BAC in warning limit, often 0.05%-0.079%)

Unsuccessful

5. Your rights and responsibilities
You should comply: Refusing a breathing test on the roadside is a criminal offense and is more punished than it - or even hard drifting claims.

You have the right to ask questions, but you usually do not have the right to consult a lawyer before the roadside (unlike a police station).

If you fail in tests at the roadside, you will be led to the station for more accurately clear breathing tests.

6. Error results of a breath
Penalties can vary by province and BAC level, but may include:

Immediate roadside licence suspensions

Vehicle impoundment

Criminal charges

Fines, jail time, and a permanent criminal record.
