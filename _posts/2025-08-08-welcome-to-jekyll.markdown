Navigating downtown Toronto is a unique challenge, but three specific areas often determine the success of a G or G2 road test. Mastering these spots not only prepares you for your exam but makes you a safer, more confident city driver for life.

## 1. The Gardiner Expressway On/Off-Ramps

The Gardiner isn't just a highway; it's a test of your ability to merge and anticipate at high speed in a condensed space.

> The key is to match the flow of traffic *before* you merge, not after. Use the full length of the ramp to get up to speed. A hesitant merge is a dangerous one.

## 2. University Avenue & Dundas Street

This intersection is a masterclass in pedestrian and traffic light management.

*   **Pedestrian Awareness:** Always scan for pedestrians who may step out unexpectedly.
*   **Light Timing:** Be aware of advanced greens and delayed reds. Don't just watch the car in front of you; watch the traffic signals themselves.

## 3. Spadina Avenue Streetcar Lanes

The central streetcar lanes on Spadina are a classic Toronto driving scenario.

### Turning Left
The biggest mistake drivers make is entering the streetcar lane too early. You should only enter the lane just before the intersection where you intend to turn.

By focusing on these three critical areas with an instructor, you'll build the muscle memory and strategic thinking needed to not just pass your test, but to truly own the road.
