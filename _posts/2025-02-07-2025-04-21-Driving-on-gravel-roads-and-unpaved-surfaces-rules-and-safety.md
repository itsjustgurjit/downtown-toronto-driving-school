Canada isn’t just a country of highways and city streets—thousands of kilometres of gravel and unpaved roads stretch across rural and remote areas. Whether you’re in the Prairies, northern Ontario, the Maritimes, or the Yukon, these roads connect small towns, farms, and recreational areas.

However, driving on them requires their own mentality and skill set compared to paved roads. Knowing the rules and using safe driving habits can prevent damage to your vehicle, avoid accidents and make your journey more fun.

legal considerations
speed limits

Provincial legal gravel applies to roads until another is laid out.

In rural areas, the standard limit can be 80 km/h, but safe speeds are often very low depending on conditions.

Rules

Pass only when safe and legal; Loose the gravel brake spacing longer.

Maintain a wide bunks of passing to reduce the risk of throwing stones on other vehicles.

Road closure and limitations

Some unpaved roads have seasonal closures due to weather damage.

Weight restrictions may apply during thaw seasons to protect roadbeds.

Justice

Dividends for farm equipment, timber cars and other large vehicles - they often take most roads.

Safety tips for gravel and unexpected roads
Reduce the speed

Loose surface reduces traction, making it easier to slip or slide.

Slow speed also makes the possibility of rock chips to minimize for windshields.

Increase at the following distance

Clouds of dust reduce visibility and flying stones can damage your car.

Maintain at least 6-8 seconds behind the vehicle.

Steer Smoothly

Sudden turns or overcorrections can cause you to lose control.

Keep both hands on the wheel and make gentle adjustments.

Brake gently

Sudden braking can lock wheels.

Use motor braking by reducing the accelerator pedal before using the brakes.

Look for dangers

Washboards, pits and soft shoulders can cause loss of control.

Crossing wildlife is more common in the countryside - be careful.

Prepare for emergency

Take an extra tire, jack, excess water and fully charged phone (or satellite equipment in remote areas).

Vehicle Considerations
Tires: All-terrain or gravel-rated tires provide better grip and durability.

Windshield Protection: Consider a protective film if you frequently travel gravel roads.

Underbody: Mud flaps and undercoating help prevent damage from rocks and debris.

Weather factor
Rain: Gravel can quickly turn into mud, which can make the roads slippery and increase the risk of stuck.

Dust: Dust can reduce the efficiency of the long -term driving motor in dust clouds - check and change the air filter regularly.

Snow and ice: In winter, dirt roads can be released less often than highways, making them even more challenging.
