Whether it's summer coating in Ontario or Winter Roadwork in British Columbia, the building areas are a common view of Canadian roads. These areas are not just a disadvantage-they are high-risk areas where security providers depend on caution.

Failing to slow down or driving recklessly in a construction area can lead to steep fines, demerit points, license suspensions, and in serious cases, criminal charges. Hereâ€™s what every driver needs to know.

1. Why are construction sectors different
The building areas often occur:

Narrow orbit and low shoulders

Workers near traffic

Sudden lane or circle

Equipment

Even a small failure of meditation can have serious consequences for workers and drivers.

2. Lower speed limit
It is clearly posted - temporary speed restrictions are usually displayed on bright orange signals.

They also apply without employees being present - many provinces reduced the limit of 24/7, while the signals are laid out, due to the ongoing dangers as different footpaths or track changes.

Double fine - in provinces such as Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, it is quickly in the building areas doubles when workers are present.

3. Penalty for speed in work areas
Penalties vary by province, but may include:

High fines - Examples: In Ontario, a work area can cost $ 300+ before introducing workers running more than 20 km/h.

Demerit -points -usually 2-4 digits for quick offenses.

License suspension - Excessive speed (40 km/h more than the range of some provinces) can cause an instant suspension on the roadside.

4. Carelessly or dangerous driving
If you:

IGNORE THE FLAGAR SIGNAL

Knit

Tailgate or brake aggressively

Drive through closed areas

... You may be accused of dangerous driving under the Penal Code or similar provincial offenses. This can mean $ 5,000, prison time and a long -term criminal journal can be fined.

5. Photoradar and automatic enforcement
Some province uses photoradar or speed cameras in work areas. These automatically detect fractures and post tickets to the registered owner of the vehicle - no officer is required.

6. Secure driving tips for building areas
Avoid fast braking quickly that can cause collision with the rear end.

Follow the instructions from the bats - they have the same rights as traffic lights and signs.

Keep the notification - see for equipment, workers and track shifts.

Leave the extra space - the following distance increases provide more response time.
