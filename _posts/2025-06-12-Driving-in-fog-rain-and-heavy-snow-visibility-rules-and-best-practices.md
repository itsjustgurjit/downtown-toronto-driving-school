Various climate in Canada means that drivers often face challenging weather - sometimes on a trip. Fog, rain and heavy snow can significantly reduce visibility, making it difficult to see the dangers and others to see you. Knowing the right techniques and legal requirements for driving with little visibility can cause all differences between being safe.

1. General Visibility Rules throughout Canada
While the nuances from the province are different, most Canadian road rules are required:

When the visibility falls below 150 meters (about the length of one and a half football area).

Use full lighting headlights and taillights so that other drivers can detect you from behind.

There is no high beam of fog or heavy snow as they reflect light back and reduce visibility.

Failure to comply can cause fines, but more importantly it increases the risk of conflict.

2. Kjører i tåke
The fog spreads the light and makes the front road look like a white wall.
Best practice:

Use low beam headlights or fog lights times high beams.

Reduce the speed and maintain extra distance.

Use the right side of the road or painted lane icons as a guide.

Avoid sudden orbit changes or braking - other drivers may not see you on time.

3. Driving in Heavy Rain
Rain affects both visibility and traction.
Best Practices:

Use low-beam headlights even during daylight hours.

Slow down to reduce hydroplaning risk.

Avoid driving through large puddles—hidden potholes can cause damage.

Ensure windshield wipers are in good condition for maximum effectiveness.

4. Driving in Heavy Snow
Snow can reduce visibility, build smooth surfaces and hide road marks.
Best practice:

Use low beams; High beams reflect falling ice and reduce clarity.

Keep the windshield, mirrors and headlights free of snow and snow.

Run slowly from normal and let it prevent long distance.

Look for the solution and give them place - they often travel slowly, but make the roads safe.

5. When Visibility Is Too Low to Drive
If you can't look beyond the length of a car:

Go to a safe place away from the traffic lane.

As long as conditions improve, keep the danger light.

Never stop in the travel field - it's extremely dangerous.
