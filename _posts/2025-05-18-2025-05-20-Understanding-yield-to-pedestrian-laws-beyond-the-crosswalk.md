In Canada, most drivers know that they must stop for pedestrians at the marked intersection. But pedestrians go a lot from the right-off-way statutory lines. Whether you drive through a busy city or a cool residential road, and know the full extent of your responsibility, you can prevent accidents, fines and dangerous misconceptions.

Main principle: Security first
Return-to-pedestrian laws are designed with a primary measure of the safety of weapons users. Canadian traffic laws require drivers to take precautions and give the rights to pedestrians, when they get into the road or about it.

But "methodically" does not always mean "inside a crossing".

Beyond the marked intersection: where the drivers are to provide
Crosswalk on cross

In most provinces, each intersection is considered a crossing, even without paint or signals.

Drivers should stop for pedestrians to mitigate these points to mitigate these points.

Intermediate block transition with pedestrian signals

Some busy streets have crossing lights without painted crosswalks.

When the pedestrian signal is activated, drivers must stop until people cleaned the path completely, including them.

School area

In school areas laid out, drivers should slow down and be ready to live for children crossing anywhere along the route - not just at the nominated intersection.

Driveway, streets and parking spaces

When entering or leaving a driveway, street or parking space, you need pedestrians on adjacent sidewalks or routes.

This rule often catches the drivers from the guard while leaving the mall or garage.

Multi-use trails and trails

Where bicycles/pedestrians cut the roads, pedestrians are usually entitled to the road if signage indicates.

"Bicycles are not pedestrians."
True - but cyclists leaving the bikes and walking are considered pedestrians under law.

Penalty for failure in return
Penalty fines from the province vary, but they can be important:

Ontario: $ 150- $ 500 fine plus 3 Demeriti points.

British Columbia: $ 167 Bot.

Quebec: $ 100- $ 200 fine.

Alberta: About $ 810 in some cases associated with violating crossfields with damage.

Failing the return also increases your insurance risk profile, and it can be a high premium.

How to stay obedient and safe
Slowly in areas with high pedestrian activity.

Scan the footpaths and write it forward - look for people to tread on the road.

Contact your eyes with pedestrians whenever possible.

Avoid blocking the intersection when you stop in traffic.

Be especially careful with poor visibility - dusk, rain and ice increase the risk.
