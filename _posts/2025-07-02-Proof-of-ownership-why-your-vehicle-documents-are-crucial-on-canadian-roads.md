Whether you drive across the city or across the country, one thing is non-conventional in Canada: the right vehicle document on hand. Proof of ownership is more than just paperwork - this is your legal protection in case of traffic stops, accidents or disputes about the validity of a vehicle.

Why do these documents mean something here and how to keep them.

1. What is the proof of ownership?
Evidence of ownership is documentation confirming that you are a valid owner of a vehicle. In Canada, the most common form is a vehicle registration permit issued by the motor vehicle's authority in the province or region.

Depending on your situation, the evidence of ownership may be included:

Vehicle Registration Certificate - Connects the vehicle to you in the official mail.

Bill of Sail - reflects the transfer of ownership from the seller to you.

Lease or financing agreement - if the vehicle is financed or rented.

2. When you need proof of ownership
a) stops during traffic
Police can request vehicle registration and driver's license at any time. Failure to present these documents can lead to punishment, even if the vehicle is legal.

B) in an accident relationship
Your insurance company will often ask for proof of ownership while processing the claim, especially if the vehicle is closed or stolen.

C) While selling or buying vehicles
To legally complete the transaction, the sale of owner documents and transfer of owner documents are necessary. Without them, the sale of provincial authorities is not recognized.

d) while walking between the provinces
If you go to a new province, you need proof of ownership to register your vehicle under the rules of new jurisdiction.

3. Why is it important
Legal compliance: A ticket or vehicle can be installed as a result of driving without evidence of ownership.

Prevention of fraud: This ensures that you can prove that the vehicle is not stolen or illegally acquired.

Smooth transactions: Just simplifies the vehicle to buy, sell or move.

4. How to keep your documents safe
In the vehicle: Keep a copy of your registration in the glove box, but avoid saving the sales bill or financing documents there.

Home: Save the original bill for sale, financing agreements and insurance documents in a safe place.

Digital copies: Some provinces allow digital evidence of insurance, but paper registration is still usually needed.

5. Results of not having evidence of ownership
If you have stopped by the police and cannot provide proof of ownership:

You can withstand fine or Demerit points (based on the province).

Your vehicle can be towed or applied.

You can withstand delays and extra costs to pick up the car.
