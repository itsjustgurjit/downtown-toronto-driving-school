Your tires are the only point of contact between the vehicle and the road. Even the most advanced safety systems - such as ABS brake or stability control - depend on functioning properly on the tires. The easiest thing is to maintain one of the most important maintenance tasks to maintain the right tire pressure. In Canada, not only is a security recommendation - it is also legal implications to ignore it.

Why tire pressure means something
Proper tire pressure affects almost every aspect of your driving experience:

Safety – Underinflated or overinflated tires can reduce traction, increase stopping distances, and make blowouts more likely.

Fuel Efficiency – Underinflated tires create more rolling resistance, forcing your engine to burn more fuel.

The lifetime of the tire - incorrect pressure causes uneven wear, shortens the lifetime of the tire.

Vehicle handling - Perfect blown tires helps predict car control and brakes.

Legal requirements in Canada
Although not a single national law specifies the exact tire pressure, provincial and regional rules require your tires to be safe and necessary for the road. It also includes:

No unsafe tire position

A tire that is clearly reduced to the point of being unsafe, resulting in a ticket or failed inspection of vehicles.

Commercial vehicle rules

Commercial trucks and buses are subject to strict tire pressure examination after national security code standards.

Winter tire rules

In provinces such as cubes (mandatory winter tires) and BC (required winter tires on some roads), proper pressure is required to meet deduction and safety requirements.

Manufacturer specification

Although the police have not been used with a meter, you can partly find the pressure on the tire below or above the recommended level, partly on the error of negligence.

Underinflated Tires: Cause excessive heat build-up, poor handling, and increased risk of blowouts.

Overinflated Tires: Reduce grip, make rides harsh, and increase the chance of impact damage.

Uneven Pressure: Can make your car pull to one side and increase wear on suspension parts.

How to check and maintain tire pressure
Feel the right tap

Check the label in your operating instructions or driver's door frames - not numbers on the tires.

Use a reliable tire gauge

Digital meters are more accurate than pencil style.

Check before menstruation and trips

The tire pressure can fall about 1 PSI for a temperature drop of 5 ° C in the Canadian winter.

Don't forget the reserve

A flat extra is useless in emergencies.

Tire pressure surveillance system (TPMS)
Most modern vehicles are equipped with TPM, which warns when a tire is significantly reduced. As help, TPMS is often triggered only when the pressure decreases by about 25%, so manual controls are still necessary.

Penalty for unsafe tires
The penalty from the province varies, usually $ 85- $ 150 per deck for unsafe conditions.

Commercial drivers can meet service orders for low tire pressure during inspections at the roadside.
