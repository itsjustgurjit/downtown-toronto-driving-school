Moving between the fields from tractors to grass clumps is agricultural vehicles a well -known scene on Canadian rural roads. While important for agricultural operations, these vehicles work under special rules that each road user and motorists understand equally.

What does an agricultural vehicle mean?
Agricultural vehicles include:

Tractor

Combination and autumn

Syringe

Wagons or trailer for the use of the farm

If they are mainly designed for farm work and not for general transport, they fall under "agricultural equipment" rules.

License and registration
Rules vary from the province, but in general:

No standard plate is required - many agricultural vehicles are released from full registration of motor vehicles if used only for agricultural purposes.

Special farms or permits - some provinces are required when covering long distances on public roads.

Valid driver's license - Operators often require at least one standard class 5 license (or provincial equivalent).

Rules of speed and road use
All agricultural vehicles that work less than a slow-signal-signal-40 km/h should show an orange triangular SMV symbol.

The use of light - floodlights and danger lights should be turned on, especially during low visibility or at night.

Lane coating - these vehicles can be widespread and occupy more than a path; Engine drivers should only pass when they are safe and legal.

Seasonal movement - planting and additional precautions are necessary during planting of road traffic with agricultural equipment.

Form vehicle tools or lots of trailers will follow security laws, including:

Appropriate bottleneck equipment

Security chain when needed

Secure load to prevent splicing on the road

Rules for other drivers
If you are facing a slow agricultural vehicle:

Be patient - not tailgate; Wait for a safe opportunity to pass.

Expect a wide turn - many farm machines are expanded when you swing or enter the fields.

Look for mud or debris - these vehicles can detect material on the road; Then adjust the speed.

Enforcement and punishment
Failure to display SMB signals can be punished by driving without necessary permits, or unheard of operation. In some provinces, serious violations can cause errors.
