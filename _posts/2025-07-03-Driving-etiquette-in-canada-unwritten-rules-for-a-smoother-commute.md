Canadian roads follow official traffic laws, but there is another layer of rules that are not in the driver's manual - unwritten behaviors. These are habits and etiquette that make daily driving smooth, safe and less stressful for everyone. You didn't get a ticket while you broke them, ignoring them can also cause disappointment, misunderstanding or dangerous conditions.

1. Zipper merging is your friend
When two lanes merge into one, oppose the request to merge very quickly. Instead, use both paths to the merger point, and then switches as a zipper. It flows traffic and reduces the overload - despite the misunderstanding that it "cuts".

2. Let people change lanes in heavy traffic
If a car indicates merging in stop-end-go traffic, you need to leave a difference. Being a territorial about the "your" path just causes stress and delay.

3. Donâ€™t Block Intersections
If the light turns green, but the traffic is stopped, wait, wait before entering the intersection. Blocking it means that cross-traffic cannot run when the light becomes the green-a certain way of provoking Gridlock and temporary.

4. Use high beam with carefully
High beams are great for rural and poorly lightweight roads, but they brake on any other vehicle when they reach any direction. This is not just humble - it's about safety and visibility for all drivers.

5. Keep the left orbit to pass
On multi -field highways, to pass the left orbit, not hover. Driving slowly in the left orbit can cause backup and risky orbit changes. Correct when passing.

6. Place trucks and buses
Large vehicles take longer to stop and have large blind spots. Avoid biting very carefully and giving them extra rooms when they indicate changing the streets.

7. Shines light like "Thanks"
In many parts of Canada, a quick flash of your father or a friendly wave is a common way that you thank someone for merging or passing. It is small, but it does goodwill.

8. Stay away from horn (until it is warned)
Canadian drivers usually use horns - this is to consume others at risk, not to reduce disappointment. This overweight can increase these conditions unnecessarily.

9. Respect pedestrians and bicycles
Even when you have technical rights, weakened roads that show respect or stop to users respect and prevent accidents.

10. Park quite
Leave enough space for others, avoid taking two places, and not parking too close to the driveway or intersection. A little extra care saves great irritation.
