Dangerous driving puts everyone at risk - from minor traffic violations to careless behavior that can lead to serious accidents. In Canada, citizens are encouraged to report dangerous drivers to help maintain traffic safety. But it is important to know how to make it safe and legal.

1. What does it mean as dangerous driving?
While each province has its own traffic laws, dangerous driving may include:

excessive speed

Tailor or aggressive class

red light

Runs under the influence of alcohol or drugs

Distracted driving (texting, meal, holding a phone)

Interest

Driving without light at night or in bad weather

Weave on the streets without signaling

If a driver's behavior puts himself or others in immediate danger, it is worth reporting.

2. When to call 911
If you feel the driver is chasing the imminent threat to public security, call 911 immediately. Examples include:

Suspected spoiled driving

A vehicle rotates dangerously in upcoming traffic

Someone makes a road or highway wrong

A hit is in progress

While calling 911, you need to give more and more details:

Vehicles, models and colors

License sign number

Travel location and direction

Description of dangerous behavior

3. When to Use Non-Emergency Lines
If the situation is concerning but not urgent (for example, repeated aggressive driving in your neighbourhood), use your local police non-emergency phone line. These numbers can be found on your municipality’s or province’s police website.

Some provinces also have online reporting portals where you can submit details, dashcam footage, or photos.

4. Reporting Commercial or Public Transit Drivers
If the dangerous driver operates a bus, taxi, rideshare, or commercial truck, you can:

Contact the company directly with the driver’s details

File a report with the relevant licensing or regulatory body (such as a provincial transportation authority)

For example, commercial drivers in Canada are held to strict safety standards, and violations can lead to licence suspension or job termination.

5. How to be safe while reporting
Don't get involved with the driver or try to stop them.

Avoid using your phone while driving - pull before calling.

If you have a dotted recording, keep it safe and give it to the police if you are asked.

6. Why reporting cases
Your call or report may be:

Stop a collision or save a life

Help the police find a reduced driver

Make an overview of frequent fractures that can cause license suspension

Encourage safe roads in your community.
