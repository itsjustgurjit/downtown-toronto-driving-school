In shared seconds it looks at your phone, adjusts the radio, or even blinking an eye, the car can slam in front. That is why the following distance is one of the most important - but is often ignored - certain basic things on Canadian roads.

"Two-second law" is a simple, proven way of having a safe place between you and the vehicle, giving you enough time to respond to sudden changes. But under some conditions, two seconds are not always enough.

What is the two-second rule?
The rule says you should stay at least two seconds in front of the vehicle - regardless of speed.

How to measure it:

Choose a specific object forward as a signapost or overpass.

As the vehicle passes it further, you can start counting: "A thousand and one, a thousand and two."

If you reach the object before ending the count, you are too close - down.

Why does two seconds work
Reaction time - takes 1–1.5 seconds to respond to average driver threats.

Stopping the distance-this place gives you time to give a break without beating, which reduces the risk of rear collision.

Visibility - more space means better views of the forward road, which helps you to estimate problems soon.

When two seconds are not enough
Some conditions require more space:

Bad weather (rain, ice, fog) → 4 seconds or more.

Give yourself extra time for night driving → Low visibility.

Gravel or unexpected roads → smooth surfaces require at least 3-4 seconds.

Breaking a trailer or driving a heavy vehicle → Preventing long distance means 5+ seconds.
Distance
To stop the distance is not just about the break - this is a mixture:

Dharna distance - it takes time to identify a danger.

Response distance - the time before the foot actually hits the brake.

Breaking distance - how long does it take to stop the vehicle completely.

At 100 km/h, your total stop spacing on the dry sidewalk is about 96 meters than the hockey hall.

Tips to maintain a secure difference
Opponent of tailoring - even if the back truck pushes you, maintain your space in front.

Use cruise control with care - helps you keep a stable speed on open highways.

Search, do not react - see the car two or three vehicles to prepare you early on the recession.

Adjusting for the environment - city traffic, rural roads and highways all require a slightly different free consciousness.
