A car horn is one of the most basic security units of your vehicle. It is designed to consume other road users at risk - not to express disappointment in traffic. Although it can be attractive to honor when someone bites you or performs the penis in green lights, Canadian laws determine clear limits so that you cannot use your horn.

Why the use of horns is regulated
Horn is high for a reason - they cut through traffic noise and immediately attract attention. But you may have excessive or unnecessary respect:

Distribute other drivers

Cyclist or pedestrian

Contribute to noise pollution

Lead to rage events

This is why their traffic rules in the provinces include the use of horns.

When it is legal for honor
All over Canada you can legally use your horn when appropriate to ensure safety. General legal use includes:

Warns another vehicle about a possible collision

If another car merges the track without seeing you.

If a driver is facing you.

Warn

When someone treads on the road without seeing.

When a cyclist unexpectedly rotates in the way of you.

Land roads go on

In some rural areas, you can summarize the drivers to consume that you are taking them (especially on the hills or on the hills).

Animal threat

To scare wildlife away from the road in rural areas.
When it is not noted for illegal or honor
Canadian law usually prohibits horn use that is unnecessary or excessive. It also includes:

Express out

To honor slow drivers, traffic jams or revenge is not a legal security reason.

Celebration

While the police can give weddings, sports victory or normally under the parade, the police can provide tickets for noise disorders in case of complaints.

Impatient in traffic lights

Just because a person does not immediately go on in green, usually discouraged and can be illegal in some provinces.

Non-fruit warning in quiet areas

Near hospitals or residential areas at night.

Provincial variations
While the original rules - only respect for security - nationwide, punishment and enforcement are different:

Ontario: Horn for Highway Traffic Act should be in good work order and used only when "appropriate necessary" for safety.

BC: The motor vehicles prohibit "unnecessary noise", including the use of the wrong horn.

Quebec: Similar laws, but the police often apply strictly in urban areas.

Alberta & Saskatchewan: Explicitly forbid horn use except as a warning or in animal hazard situations.

Punishment
Use of inappropriate horns can lead to results:

Fine $ 50 to $ 200 based on province

Potential Demerit points in some cases if the careless driving is bound by driving

Noise disturbance citations from municipal bylaws

Practical honor
Short, Quick Tap = Humble Alert.

Long, constant respect = only emergency warning.

Avoid at night until it is necessary for safety.

If someone respects you to help you avoid danger, thank you wave or gesture.
