Finding the right parking space is not always easy - but when you do, you still have to make sure it is legal. In Canada, parking laws are designed to protect the roads, make traffic flows and keep access points clear. Due to the misunderstanding of the rules, your license may have expensive tickets, ropes or even marks.

Here is the collapse of regular parking restrictions and how to avoid problems.

1. Understand labeling labeling
In some cities, forgetful color restrictions indicate:

Yellow -colored curbs often mean no parking or loading zone.

Red carb (less common in Canada) usually does not stop any time at any time.

Blue curb permits can nominate available parking spaces for holders.

Always check for the signs posted in addition to the marked marks - the override color code in most cases.

2. Parking near fire hydrant
It is important for need to keep the fire hydrant ready.

Most provinces require at least 3 meters withdrawal on each side of the hydrant.

Although there is no yellow paint or signage, the rule applies.

Parking can be very tightly fined and ropes, and if the vehicle blocks the fire extinguishing effort, the penalty can be severe.

3. No-parking vs no-stop zone
These two words are not interchangeable:

No parking: You can stop cards to leave or take passengers, but you cannot leave the vehicle unattainable.

No restrictions: You cannot stop the vehicle at all, even if a moment, except for traffic signals or to avoid conflict.

4. Regular parking area
In Canada you usually can't park:

Within a cross or crossed.

On the sidewalk or bullet.

In many provinces, a stop sign or pedestrians within 9 meters from the intersection.

In front of the entrance to driveways, streets or private property.

In the bicycle lane, until special permission is finished.

5. Available parking space
Reserved available parking spaces are for vehicles showing a valid permit issued by the province or area. Parking can cause heavy fines, often more than $ 300, and ropes.

6. Winter Parking Restrictions
Some municipalities ban overnight street parking during winter months to allow snowplows to clear the roads. These rules may be in effect seasonally or triggered by specific snowfall amounts.

7. Penalty for illegal parking
The results differ from the location, but may include:

A fine from $ 30 to $ 300.

Vehicles to and impressed fees.

Potential Demerit pointer whose crime also involves unprotected banning.
