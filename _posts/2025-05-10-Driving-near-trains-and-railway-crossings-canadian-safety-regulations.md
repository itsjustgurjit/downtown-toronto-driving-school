Trains may not often appear as cars on Canadian roads, but when they do, games are high. Railway crossings require full attention - because in any collision between the train and the vehicle always wins the train.

Canadian railway crossing laws are designed to protect drivers, passengers and railway workers. Understanding the rules and following them every time can save lives.

1. Understand the railroad crossing in Canada
Railway crossings are those who have a cross with public or private train trains. They can be:

Controlled crossing - equipped with bright lights, gates and bells.

Uncontrolled crossing - marked with just a railroad crossing sign (called a crossbuck), without any active warning system.

Regardless of the type, drivers are legally necessary to contact with care.

2. Federal and provincial overview
In Canada, the railroad crossing of the transport of both Canada rules and provincial traffic laws is controlled. Great requirements include:

After all crossing signals and signs.

To get the right to route for trains at all times.

Stop at least 5 meters from the nearest rail when needed.

3. When you have to stop
Drivers should come to a complete stop if:

Leather red lights are active.

The gates are reduced or decreases.

A train is visible or gets the horny sound and is within 500 meters from the intersection.

A railway crossing flagperson signals you to stop.

Have you ever tried to "try to defeat the train" - more than a mile can be more than a mile.

4. Special rules for school buses and some vehicles
In many provinces, school buses, buses that carry passengers and transport cars of dangerous goods, must be stopped at all railroad crossings, although no train comes. The driver needs:

Open the bus or vehicle door (for buses) to listen to trains.

Just move on when it is completely safe.

5. Safety tips for drivers
Be ready to stop when the intersection gets closer and be ready.

See and listen in both directions, especially on uncontrolled crossings.

Never stop on the tracks - unless there is enough space on the other side to clean the intersection, there are no disorders.

Follow flag papers at railway construction or maintenance places.

Be extra warning in winter, when snow and ice can make it difficult to stop in time.

6. Penalty for violations
Ignoring rules for railroad crossing can lead to results:

Punishment (from $ 150 to more than $ 500 on the basis of the province).
